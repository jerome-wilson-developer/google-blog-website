Thanks, Raunak for your help on what needs to be corrected. 5 specs require changes ... these are the locations of my changes ... 

#1) ADD B,EM,U TO <P> TAG: Added at <nav class="social-media-links"> ... <p><b><em><u>Follow us on:</u></em></b></p> and also:  <article class="centered"><button><a href=""><p><b><em>Start NOW</em></b></p>.

#2 Add a Blockquote: I added a blockquote from "Steve Jobs" on the blog page. The blockquote is at the top of the sidebar.

#3 Add an image caption: I added the image caption on the Contact Us page as the hero-image.

#4 Use Grid at least twice: I used both times on the index.html page ...  .main-container {display: grid;width: 100%; and .social-media-links {display: grid; width: 100%;

#5 Use flexbox at least twice: I used flexbox almost 10 times throughout this blog site.

#6 Contact Us page: Remove CSS from HTML tags and add the styling to the stylesheet. All CSS has been removed from HTML.
